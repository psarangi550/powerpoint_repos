# <ins> Selection Pane in PPT and how to make the object behind and infront of each other  </ins> #

- the selection pane can be open in `home` &rarr; `select` &rarr; `selection pane`

- whenever there is a `shape` on the `working Area` or `outside of working Area` as well all those `shape info` will be shown in `selection pane Area`

- if we want to put one shape behind another shape then we can just `drag the shape which we want to put it under` and then `put it below the one which we want to see on the top`

- we can also do the same bny using `shape format` &rarr; (bring forward or sent backward) option which can do the same thing 

- here we want to do the same we can also do that by using the option as `right click on the shape` &rarr; (bring forward or sent backward) option
